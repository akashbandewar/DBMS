Introducing Relational Databases.
*************************************

1) Which field of the Customers table is the primary key?
--> CNUM

2) What is the 4th column of the Customers table?
-->RATING

3) What is another word for row? For column?
--> Rows in DBMS is known as Record 
    Rows in RDBMS is also known as Tuple, Entity
    Column in DBMS is known as Field 
    Column in RDBMS is also known as Attribute, Method

4) Why isn’t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
--> It is not possible to fetch the first five rows (as they were inserted in the table) of the table, 
    because in RDBMS, the rows are stored as a separate file in the Database server HardDisk and they can be anywhere in the ROM.
    As the rows are not stored sequentially, we can't access them as per the inserted sequence. Rather, when we search the data, 
    the data is being searched in HardDisk according to the address. So whichever address is found and matched first, that data is returned first.
